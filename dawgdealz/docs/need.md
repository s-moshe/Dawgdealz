# DawgDealz: A Better Solution for UW Students

Craigslist is a well-known platform for buying and selling items locally, but it doesn't fully address the needs of students. Here’s a breakdown of what Craigslist does well, its shortcomings, and how DawgDealz improves on it.

---

## What Craigslist Does Well
- **It’s Free:** Anyone can list or buy items without paying a fee, which makes it accessible.
- **Wide Audience:** With a broad user base, there are plenty of listings, increasing the chances of finding specific items.
- **Simple to Use:** Craigslist’s straightforward layout makes browsing or posting items easy.

## Problems with Craigslist

### Not Student-Focused
- Craigslist caters to everyone, not just students. This leads to a lot of irrelevant listings, like cars or job ads, which may not appeal to students.
- There are no categories specifically for student needs, such as “textbooks” or “dorm furniture.”

### Safety Concerns
- Users interact with strangers, which can feel unsafe, especially when meeting in person to exchange items.
- Scams are prevalent since Craigslist doesn’t verify users or their listings.

### Too Broad
- Craigslist lacks the ability to filter listings to just UW students, making it harder to find local deals or connect with others on campus.

### Old-Fashioned Design
- Craigslist’s design feels outdated and lacks modern features like in-app chat or notifications, which could make communication more efficient.

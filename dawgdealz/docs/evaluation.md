**Feedback We Received on Usability and Utility**
“I liked how the interface was straightforward, with labels and icons clearly labeled. I would use this app in real life because I always have a few items on hand that I don't use anymore, and it would be cool to connect with other UW students about selling things I don't use/crafts/knick knacks/etc. It's very helpful that contacting others automatically brings a user to a email template, but considering a built-in chat feature would also be another potential feature to think about!” - erinsong@uw.edu

“Loved the experience, what a great application.” jackchoq@uw.edu 

“10/10 experience with the app, the only want would be to include a refresh feature on all pages, not just the home for ease of use. Personally, I like to have a trust rating system for sellers to see whether or not the item being sold is genuine or may be unknowingly broken. Otherwise, it feels like a better, more official version of the UW snapchat with people selling things!” - colinlim@uw.edu

“When setting up my account, it was not clear that my password had an error because it was < 6 characters. I would suggest using additional characters and colors to clearly indicate the error message. Overall, it felt very intuitive to use! It streamlined the process of selling items :D” crystr2@uw.edu _**Note: Based on this feedback, we actually ended up patching this bug in DawgDealz in order to improve usability!_

“Overall, I really liked the app! It was very intuitive and easy to use. I would definitely use it if it's available :D” -kimjoogy@uw.edu

Much of our app was already wrapped in semantics. However, after the audit, we made several changes to improve accessibility, including changing the color of most of the buttons so that they stand out more against the background. We made sure to select a color that has high contrast against the background color (ex. Dark purple buttons with white text). We also noted some small text contrast issues that were not noted in the audit so we make fixes by changing the text color (ex. changing text from grey to true white) and made sure to be as consistent as possible in order to not impact the UI design of our app. Furthermore, we added a semantic label to all the cards of items on the home page, which was a major issue from the audit. Inside the more detailed item description view, we already required users to write a description of their item’s photo. However, we recognize that writing descriptive text is difficult for users who have no background knowledge on accessibility (writing good alt text is hard!), so we added the option to auto generate a starter description based off of the item’s text using Gemini AI. Lastly, for greater understandability and operability, we added instructions to the image description view to guide users towards sliding through the listing images.
